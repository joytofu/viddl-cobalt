Saving functionality simplifies downloading content from the internet and takes zero liability for what the saved content is used for.
processing servers work like advanced proxies and don't ever write any content to disk.
Everything is handled in RAM and permanently purged once the tunnel is done.
We have no downloading logs and can't identify anyone.
