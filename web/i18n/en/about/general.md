All requests to the backend are anonymous and all information about tunnels is encrypted.
We have a strict zero log policy and don't track *anything* about individual people.

When a request needs additional processing, cobalt processes files on-the-fly.
It's done by tunneling processed parts directly to the client, without ever saving anything to disk.
This method is used when the source service provides video and audio channels as separate files.

Additionally, you can [enable forced tunneling](/settings/privacy#tunnel) to protect your privacy.
When enabled, Vetra will tunnel all downloaded files.
No one will know where you download something from, even your network provider.
