We've all been there. You find a hilarious or fascinating video on Reddit, you use an online tool to download it, and when you play the file... silence. The audio is completely missing. It’s one of the most common frustrations when trying to save content from the platform.

The good news is, you're not doing anything wrong, and there's a very simple fix.

This guide will not only show you the easiest way to download Reddit videos **with sound** included but also explain *why* this problem happens in the first place. Get ready to save your favorite clips perfectly, every time.

## Why Do Most Reddit Downloads Have No Audio?

The culprit is a technology called DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP). To optimize for fast loading and smooth playback, Reddit often stores the video and the audio for a clip as two separate files.

When you use a basic downloader, it often only grabs the primary video file and completely misses the separate audio track. It doesn't know to look for it and combine them.

To get the full clip with sound, you need a tool that is specifically designed to identify both the video and audio streams, download them simultaneously, and merge them into a single, complete MP4 file for you. And that's exactly what our tool does.

## The 3-Step Method to Save Reddit Videos with Audio

Forget about digging through page source code or using complicated developer tools. Our method is designed to be incredibly simple and works perfectly on both desktop and mobile browsers.

### Step 1: Copy the Reddit Video URL

Navigate to the Reddit post containing the video you want to save. You don't need to be on the video's direct file page; the post page itself is perfect.

Simply copy the full URL from your browser's address bar.



### Step 2: Paste the URL into Our Downloader

Head over to our **[free Reddit Video Downloader tool](/reddit-video-downloader)**. You'll see a simple input box right at the top of the page.

Paste the URL you just copied directly into that box. Our tool will automatically recognize it as a Reddit link.



### Step 3: Click "Download"

Hit the "Download" button. Our system will instantly process the link, fetching both the high-definition video and the separate audio track.

In just a moment, it will generate the download links for you, typically offering different quality options. Choose your preferred quality, and the video will be saved to your device as a standard MP4 file, with the audio perfectly synced. It's that simple.

## Is it legal to download Reddit videos?
Downloading videos from Reddit for personal use—like saving a funny meme to show a friend or keeping a tutorial for offline viewing—is generally considered acceptable under fair use principles. However, redistributing, re-uploading, or using the content for commercial purposes without the original creator's permission can be a violation of copyright. Always respect the intellectual property of creators.

## Does this downloader work on mobile (iPhone/Android)?
Yes, absolutely. Our website is fully mobile-responsive. You can copy the URL from the Reddit app (using the "Share" button and then "Copy Link") and paste it into our tool using your mobile browser (like Safari or Chrome) just as you would on a desktop.

## Why do some Reddit posts not have a download option?
Our tool is designed specifically for downloading native Reddit videos (v.redd.it links). If a Reddit post links to an external site like YouTube or Imgur, or if it's a text-only post or an image gallery, there is no video file hosted on Reddit to download. In those cases, you would need to use a downloader for that specific platform (e.g., our YouTube downloader).

## Do I need a Reddit account to use this?
No. You do not need to be logged into a Reddit account to download a public video. As long as the post is publicly accessible, you can simply copy its URL and use our tool.

## What video format will my download be in?
Your video will be downloaded in the **MP4** format. This is the most universal video format, compatible with virtually all devices, media players, and video editing software, ensuring you can play it anywhere without issues.
